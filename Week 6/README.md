Authentication log analyzer

Runs by using the script "python auth_scanner.py ScannedLogFile"

This scanner reports the total failed log in attemps with their corresponding user and source IP address. 

I parsed my logs using Counter as it cleaner and easier to read and it is also an indutry standard. 

The scanner detects which logs are malformed and creates an output of those said logs. 

After I created my script, I asked AI to help me make any imporvments to the script that would mode it run smoother and I had it help me check that the script had all of the requirements for the scanner.

I tested my scanner by creating the script step by step. I made sure my parsing worked, then my error handeling, then the log counter. 

The most difficult part of this project was making sure the script met all of the requirements. There was a lot that had to be in the script but breaking it down step by step was a big help.
