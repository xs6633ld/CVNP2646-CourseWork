File Organizer, great tool for anyone to organize thier files into meaningful folders.

Runs by running "python organizer.py"

Filters files into folders named archives, audio, video, images, documents, executables, and other.

Pathlib is the recomended design as it is easy to write and way more readable. This helps you to have a better undertsanding of the script. Existing files are put into their correct category of folders. For example, is a file has a .jpg extension, it will be put into the images folder. This script also avoids overwriting existing files by renaming the file. 

I used ChatGPT to help with my algorythem design. This was a big help to allow me to complete this script and give me a better understanding of how what I am writing works. I perfected some of the scanner and file mover part to make it work with the files I had. 

The set up of this project was difficult but doing things section by section made it a lot easier.
